                    fun the basis of my company and my life as I've been doing this since high school,
                    back then it was among friends and not a company. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today it's the same idea, the

                    There are currently 21 companies under the legal entity “M4 Empire”. This is based

                                    <li>M4 Bet: Well if you love to try out betting and you're not sure how to go about it. That
                                        where we come into the equation we give the best authentic odds to our clients and the
                                        community in general in order to generate income. These odds are generated by well
                                        experienced punters with good track records so you've got nothing to worry about. Though also
                                        remember that there is no 100% sure odds every odd is a risk but worth taking, I mean life itself
                                        is a risk but we as well still live it anyways.
                                        We hope to one day grow into a full betting platform designed to help the people win rather than
                                        constantly taking(COMING SOON)</li>

                        <h1>The Vision</h1>
                        <p>The vision of M4 Empire is to build a community that offers affordable solutions to
                            different human-related problems ranging from travel to business, transport,
                            housing, charity, event planning and even cryptocurrency trading. The plan is to
                            achieve these goals through the sale and purchase of NFTs (solidified crypto).
                            NFT’s can be simply seen as solidified crypto. In the sense that the NFT’s can only
                            be purchased on the blockchain with cryptocurrency. Automatically, when you buy
                            an NFT token with your coin, you have solidified that coin at a certain price and so it
                            will not be affected by the rise and fall of the actual coin. The moment an NFT is
                            bought, your attention shifts from the coins to the tokens. That is, the NFT token
                            you just bought. This is because profits can only be made on NFT’s by selling them
                            back to the community that owns them or back to the blockchain that releases
                            them. Now in most cases, no one knows the creators of these tokens because after
                            they sell, they do not care about the customers and so therefore those tokens are
                            bound to lose value, and for that those customers lose money.
                            A Business NFT token, unlike regular tokens, has benefits from the companies that
                            own the token. It automatically gives customers value for their money without
                            selling the actual token itself. M4 empire has 21 companies under it and at the end
                            of the year will be releasing 10 collections with a total of 50 tokens. 10 of our
                            companies and 5 tokens to each company. Each token will have a different benefit
                            from the other as every token will only have 100 pieces. And so, each benefit I
                            announce as the year goes by and we finalize plans before the project launch in
                            December will only be available to the first 100 people who purchase it when it
                            launches.
                            Every company will have the same base price for its tokens as the company's token
                            is based off the company's credibility and the ability to deliver the said benefits. For
                            now, I only have two examples I'm sure of, which I use to express my point, seeing
                            as I am still working on organizing the benefits properly for all of them. The first
                            one would be the Travel agency (M4 Travels). The base price for this company’s
                            token is set at $300, and this token states that anyone that holds this token for
                            exactly 1 year after purchase, gets an automatic 70% off any trip anywhere in the
                            world with M4 Travels. The second would be the automobile company (M4 Autos).
                            The base price at this company's token is $250, and this token states that anyone
                            who can hold it for 7 months after purchase gets an automatic 35% off any car they
                            want with M4 Autos.
                            These are just two examples of which I am sure both tokens will be available at the
                            launch. I am currently working on the remaining 48 benefits for the final 48 tokens.
                            As I stated earlier, NFT’s are solidified crypto and so they only rise based off the
                            ability of the creator to keep people interested in them (Basic Supply and Demand
                            System), and this can only happen with the creator's ability to meet up with the
                            benefits being promised. And that is the reason why business NFT’s should be
                            thoroughly thought through as to not disappoint customers with failed promises.</p>
